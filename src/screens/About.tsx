						The Parity Signer mobile application is a secure air-gapped wallet
						developed by Parity Technologies. It allows users to use a
						smartphone as cold storage.
					</Text>
					<Text style={styles.text}>
						This application is meant to be used on a phone that will remain
						offline at any point in time. To upgrade the app, you need to make
						sure you backup your accounts (e.g by writing the recovery phrase on
						paper), then factory reset the phone, then install Parity Signer's
						new version either from the store (iPhone or android) or from a sd
						card, and finally turn your phone offline for good before recoveing
						or generating new accounts.
					</Text>
					<Text style={styles.text}>
						Any data transfer from or to the App will happen using QR code
						scanning. By doing so, the most sensitive piece of information, the
						private keys, will never leave the phone. The Parity Signer mobile
						app can be used to store Ethereum or Kusama accounts. This includes
						ETH, ETC or Ether from various testnets (Kovan, Ropstenâ€¦) as well as
						KSMs.
					</Text>
					<Text style={styles.text}>
						This app does not send any data to Parity Technologies or any
						partner. The app works entirely offline once installed.
					</Text>
					<Text style={styles.text}>
						The code of this application is available on Github (
